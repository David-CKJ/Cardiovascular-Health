# Cardiovascular-Health
## About
This is a SC1015 Mini-Project on Cardiovascular Health. In this project, we will analyse the dataset [Cardiovascular Disease](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/colewelkins/cardiovascular-disease) to assess the reliability of Blood Pressure (BP) as an indicator for Cardiovascular Health. We will do so by finding the correlation between BP and various lifestyle variables, and comparing BP with other health indicators. For a detailed walkthrough, please view the source code in the following order:

1. Data Cleaning
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Machine Learning
